I care deeply about digital publishing. I fell into the industry by accident, in fact, but the more I learn about this interesting industry, the more I find my place. Here's how I've contributed:


## Developed Contextual EPUB Checker
For eBooks, [EPUBCheck](https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck) can only go so far&ndash;it only checks for strict validity, not whether your eBook will render correctly on your intended eReader. My tool helps you know when it may not.

## Designer
Software just works better when it functions AND when it makes sense. Design helps bring the function to form without the need of extensive documentation to know how A connects to B.

## Customer Service
A wonderful platform can leave a bad taste if the customer service sours everything. Once you establish your product, it's becomes more important to keep the customer service top-notch.

## Content Movement
Products aren't stationary during production: they MUST move. Usually they move through a bunch of hands. Doing all of that manually is time-consuming. I can make that easy.

## Metadata Expert
Some products are incredible, but customers don't know that upfront all the time. Metadata is the first impression that they'll get. My experience with metadata in the industry can help you shape and supply data that matters.

## Automated EPUB fixer
Some EPUB bugs are just that: pesky bugs. Some bugs can be squashed simply, and I have the tools to do that without looking. These bugs aren't worth our time.
