I should know how [OpenStruct works].\n- Rails? I should understand the [request cycle].\n- SQL? I should understand [database views] and [triggers].\n- Git? I should understand [how to rebase].\n- CI? I should understand my **tool of choice**.\n\nWhy? Because it makes me a better developer. I expose myself to new patterns,\nlearn new concepts, and have those solution-patterns in my toolbox for when\nI need to solve problems.\n\nToday, I want to talk about my tool of choice for Continuous Integration.\n\n[reading the manual]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM\n[how to rebase]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase\n[request cycle]: https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/examining-internals-of-rails-request-response-cycle/\n[OpenStruct works]: https://medium.com/@farsi_mehdi/openstruct-in-ruby-ab6ba3aff9a4\n[database views]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial-views.html\n[triggers]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-createtrigger.html\n\n","fields":{"slug":"/2018-08-26-ruby-rails-and-circle-ci-workflows/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"26 August, 2018","title":"Ruby, Rails, and CircleCI 2.0 Workflows"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"\nStructs and maps are easy to work with in Elixir, but if they are stored\nin the database as JSON and accessed via an Ecto Schema, it's not as\nclear how to query them.
