I really\nrecommend looking at it for your next web application.</p>\n<p>One of the things I love about LiveView is that it enables me to consolidate\nsome of common front-end logic into the backend, where the source of truth\nbelongs. A great example is a form, especially long-running or multi-step forms.</p>\n<p>Let me show you what I mean.</p>\n<video controls loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"/long-form-demo-40ae7ab2ef6f6866b0efffa321f5f6c3.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is\n     a <a href=\"/long-form-demo-40ae7ab2ef6f6866b0efffa321f5f6c3.mp4\">link to the video</a> instead.</p>\n</video>\n<p>There’s a couple of components you see in here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DatePicker (LiveView)</li>\n<li>Vue-mounted TipTap WYSIWYG editor (LiveView, and also mounts a Vue component)</li>\n<li>Recurrence component (hidden behind a checkbox, not demoed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I coded this form twice.</p>\n<h2>The Ugly Way</h2>\n<p>First, I coded it all with a single LiveView. I was still trying to figure out\nwhat I wanted on the form, but eventually this LiveView was an ugly 1000-line\nhorror that managed state in multiple places like the changeset and the socket.\nIt was pretty terrible. There has to be a better way. It’s a single <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;form&gt;</code>\nthat handled all the attributes, and each step was simply hidden until you hit\n“next”.</p>\n<p>It was something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"eex\">\n      <pre class=\"language-eex\"><code class=\"language-eex\"></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Second time around I decided to lean more into LiveComponents</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Phoenix LiveView: Multi-step forms","date":"May 13, 2020","tags":["elixir","ecto","phoenix"],"originalUrl":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/liveview-multi-step-form/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/vim-elixir-ls-plug/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Managing ElixirLS updates in Neovim with asdf and vim-plug","tags":["elixir","vim"],"originalUrl":null,"excerpt":"How I manage ElixirLS, neovim, and coc.nvim with vim-plug."}},"next":null}}
