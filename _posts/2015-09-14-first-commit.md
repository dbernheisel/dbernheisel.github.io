Switched it up to Jekyll and Github.io. Needed a changeup and something that's still managable and beautiful. Luckily, this is a great combo and keeps me in my favorite editor, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). What should you expect for me?

## Setup
Also found a great theme by [this guy](https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme) to help shape up the site, adding some flexibility without issue. And the best part about the theme? I can understand the code the first time I read it. Props.

## What to look forward to from me
Hopefully some helpful lessons that I learned the hard way. Also some random musings from retro games ([thanks libRetro](http://www.libretro.com/)). I'm attending The Iron Yard in Durham, NC right now learning Ruby on Rails, with some peppering of HTML, CSS, SQL, and Javascript. Afterwards, I'll continue learning and writing guides and contributing to open source projects.

## Why should you care?
You don't need to, but I really appreciate others' blogs and random guides. I want to contribute back! This is where I'll do that.

## Wordpress
I came from Wordpress; the _nasty_ world of PHP and semicolons. I toyed around with themes and plugins, but I always kinda thought it was overkill for what I wanted. Yes, it was practice; no, it was not practical for my _environment_.

## Google+, Twitter, Facebook
I quit Facebook. Not useful. Maybe it was my fault, but I felt like it became junk and didn't enhance my relationships with people.

Google+ is nice, but it's not quite curating the feed to interesting things quite yet. I like the communities and browsing it though. I'm there, but don't contribute much on Google+. If that's your flavor, hit me up at [+DavidBernheisel](https://plus.google.com/+DavidBernheisel)

Twitter is "it" right now and really has the flexibility, ease-of-use, and most importantly, content. Hit me up at [@bernheisel](https://twitter.com/bernheisel).
