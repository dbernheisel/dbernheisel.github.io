Switched it up to Jekyll and Github.io. Needed a changeup and something that's still managable and beautiful. Luckily, this is a great combo and keeps me in my [favorite editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Also found a great theme by [this guy](https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme) to help shape up the site, adding some flexibility without issue. And the best part about the theme? I can understand the code the first time I read it. Props.

## What to look forward to from me
Hopefully some helpful lessons that I learned the hard way. Also some random musings from retro games ([thanks libRetro(http://www.libretro.com/)])

## Why should you care?
You don't need to, but I really appreciate others' blogs and random guides. I want to contribute back! This is where I'll do that.
