I joined the [Thinking |> Elixir] Podcast! I'm really happy to be joining
friends like [@brainlid] and Cade to talk about my favorite programming
language.

I would really love it if you tweeted about the new podcast and shared with your
friends who know or are discovering Elixir. We're wanting it to be a good and
succinct source to catch up on Elixir news and happenings, with some interviews
with other Elixir folks!

Check it out at https://thinkingelixir.com/the-podcast or your favorite source
for podcasts (Google, Apple, etc.).

In the first episode, we're introducing ourselves and getting to know each
other.
