  Know your tools -- CircleCI 2.0 Workflows
---

There's a movement lately in the development world that I've really enjoyed:

> "Know your tools"
> -- Tool authors, probably

It's encouraged me to dive deeper into the tools that I use every day and
understand more how they work.

- Ruby? I should know how [OpenStruct works].
- Rails? I should understand the [request cycle].
- SQL? I should understand [database views] and [triggers].
- Git? I should understand [how to rebase].
- CI? I should understand my **tool of choice**.

Why? Because it makes me a better developer. I expose myself to new patterns,
learn new concepts, and have those solution-patterns in my toolbox for when
I need to solve problems.

Today, I want to talk about my tool of choice for Continuous Integration.

## CircleCI 2.0

My tool of choice for Continuous Integration lately is CircleCI 2.0. I've
really enjoyed it. I don't think I went out of my way to pick them, honestly,
but a couple of co-workers before me setup projects that I work on with
CircleCI; I think they made a good choice.

Depending on how long ago the project was setup for CI, you might be using
CircleCI 1.0 configurations, which is [deprecating on EOD August 31,
2018][sunset-1-0].

Enter my problem: I had a project using CircleCI 1.0, so I needed to migrated
quickly. Our deployment process also happens via CI, so I didn't want that to
stop.

Time for me to dive into CircleCI.

### What is CircleCI?

I'll keep it short here, [because they do a better job explaining who they
are][CircleCI]. CircleCI is a service that uses containers to build your code,
test your code, and deploy your code.

What are containers? [They are isolated environments that run
software.][containers] CircleCI 2.0 uses containers to manage your code, and
extends that container configurability to your projects.

[CircleCI]: https://circleci.com/product/
[containers]: https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container

### How do I configure _my_ container?

This is the "know your tools" part. Thankfully, CircleCI provides a lot of
great [documentation] and [samples]. Since this is an article about Ruby and
Rails, using their [Rails tutorial] will be enough to get you going.

In their [Rails tutorial], they are using one container to build your project
and test your code. I could modify it to also deploy my project; it's simple to
add another step:

```yaml
# replace "production" with integration, staging, or whatever else environment
# you need to deploy.
- run: git config --global user.name "CircleCI"
- run: bundle exec cap production deploy
```

Using Capistrano makes it easy to deploy for most Rails applications. Above
assumes you've configured the CircleCI project to [have the appropriate SSH
keys][ssh], so it can log into the server and perform the needed steps.

At this point you you could be done if you're in the same boat as me and need
to move off of CircleCI 1.0 and onto CircleCI 2.0. But, this isn't really about
migrating from CircleCI 1.0 to CircleCI 2.0; we're here to learn!

[ssh]: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/add-ssh-key/

## Not everything has to be together

I decided to explore a little further and use another CircleCI feature:
[workflows]

In my development environment, everything happens on my machine. I like my
machine because it's the way I made it. I like using [brew] to install
dependencies, but the CI environment runs Linux, which my production
environment also runs.

CircleCI leverages containers to help keep "software units" separate and pure.
This is smart because I need these environments to be accurately reproducible
and not fragile to some other dependency being introduced. Have you ever
installed a different version of OpenSSL to "fix" one project, but totally
borked other projects on your machine? Containers prevent this problem.

When you think about what your CI process does, there's probably a couple of
large tasks happening:

- Install language versions
- Install dependencies outside of your language (like imagemagick)
- Install dependencies in your language (with bundler)
- Install dependencies in your _other_ language (with npm)
- Precompile assets
- Run Ruby tests
- Run JavaScript tests (you wrote those, right?)
- Run linting checks (your team agrees on the same style, right?)
- Deploy the working code

With containers, we can separate these tasks. This has some benefits because we
can run some of these in parallel instead of serially; that might give us
a speed boost; more importantly, it communicates better where the failure is
happening, if it happens ðŸ¤ž

![GitHub Integration](./circleci2-github.png)

Also, what if your ruby tests fail-- wouldn't you also like to know if your
JavaScript tests fail? Most of the CI scripts I've seen will stop on the first
failed command which doesn't give you a complete picture.

[workflows]: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/jobs-steps/#section=getting-started
[brew]: https://brew.sh/

## Gotta keep 'em separated

For installing the language versions, I used to rely on tools like [asdf] and
[nvm] and [rbenv], but I realized that I _shouldn't_ need to use those tools
when using containers. I need those tools for my local development environment
so I can switch between projects, but not when I can use a container image that
has the language versions I need already installed for _this_ project.

Enter: [CircleCI docker images].

CircleCI provides some great container images with good tools included like
[dockerize], [xvfb], and [chromedriver], which saves you from having to worry
about installing those manually. Let's use their images.

**What is [Dockerize]?**
It's a small bash utility that is used to wait on database containers to be
ready _before_ trying to have tests run against them.

**What is [xvfb] and [chromedriver]?**
Good question, I don't really understand it, but I know I need it to allow some
browser tests to run. Just roll with it.

In my case, my project is using Ruby 2.5.1 but unfortunately requires Node 6.x
because of an older node-based asset pipeline; CircleCI's Ruby image
[Dockerfile] includes Node 8.x. I can't run `npm install` under Node 8.x.
That's OK though, because we can separate them with containers.

## Let's try this out

According to CircleCI docs, I'll need to define multiple jobs. I'll try to keep
the jobs focused on one task. Let's start with two tasks:

1. Bundle Install
1. NPM Install. The production environment doesn't use Yarn, so I shouldn't
   either in CI yet. Also, Node 6.x doesn't ship with npm that supports
   `package-lock.json`. ::sigh:: I'll leave some commented-out code though in
   case you can use it.

```yaml
jobs:
  bundle-install:
    working_directory: ~/repo
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.1-node-browsers
        environment:
          BUNDLE_JOBS: 4
          BUNDLE_RETRY: 3
          BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle
          DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://root@localhost/my_project_test?pool=5"
    steps:
      - checkout
      - attach_workspace:
          at: ~/repo
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
          - bundle-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
          # We add "arch" as a key since some gems compile native code, like
          # nokogiri. If for whatever reason CircleCI runs the job on a machine
          # with a different architecture, the cache would be invalid.
      - run: bundle install
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - ./vendor/bundle
          key: bundle-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: .
          paths:
            - vendor/bundle

  npm-install:
    working_directory: ~/repo
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:6
    steps:
      - checkout
      - attach_workspace:
          at: ~/repo
      # Enable when using npm5+
      # - restore_cache:
      #     keys:
      #     - node-modules-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
      #       We add "arch" as a key since some packages compile native code, like
      #       node-sass. If for whatever reason CircleCI runs the job on a machine
      #       with a different architecture, the cache would be invalid.
      - run: npm --version
      - run: node --version
      - run: npm install
      - run: mkdir -p public/assets/frontend
      - run: npm run production
      # Enable when using npm5+
      # - save_cache:
      #     paths:
      #       - node_modules
      #     key: node-modules-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.lock" }}
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: .
          paths:
            - node_modules
            - public/assets/frontend
```

Looking good so far. I'm not doing anything special but there are a couple of
concepts we should know:

- Cache: This is used to save dependencies across runs.
- Workspace: This is used to save data as the workflow continues, so the next
  step can use the results of a previous step like `node_modules` and
  `vendor/bundle`. We attach the workspace at the beginning, and then persist
  some resulting files to the workspace at the end of the task.

For my project, we when we run `npm run production`, it compiles assets into
the folder `public/assets/frontend`. I need that to run my tests later.

Let's move on to the test step:

```yaml
test:
  working_directory: ~/repo
  docker:
    # The first image is the primary image. This is where the commands below
    # will run within.
    - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.1-node-browsers
      environment:
        BUNDLE_JOBS: 4
        BUNDLE_RETRY: 3
        BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle
        DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://root@localhost/my_project_test?pool=5"
    # For more information about how these images work, check our their READMEs
    # https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/ruby/
    # https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/postgres/
    # https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/
    - image: circleci/postgres:9.3-alpine-ram
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: root
        POSTGRES_DB: my_project_test
  steps:
    - checkout
    - attach_workspace:
        at: ~/repo
    - run: dockerize -wait tcp://localhost:5432 -timeout 1m
    - run: cp config/secrets.yml{.example,}
    - run: cp config/database.yml{.example,}
    - run: bundle install
    - run: RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:schema:load --trace
    - run: |
        mkdir -p ~/repo/tmp/test-results/rspec
        bundle exec rspec --profile 10 --format RspecJunitFormatter --out ~/repo/tmp/test-results/rspec/results.xml --format progress
    - store_artifacts:
        path: ~/repo/tmp/screenshots
        destination: test-screenshots
    - store_test_results:
        path: ~/repo/tmp/test-results
```

Since we're attaching the workspace, we can assume that we have our
`node_modules` and `vendor/bundle` already present. We still run `bundle
install`, but it's incredibly quick since the workspace already has the info--
bundler just needs to recognize it.

I want to point out another CircleCI feature: [collecting test metadata].

There's a popular XML format for expressing test outputs and metadata, like the
time it took to run each test; [JUnit] popularized this format. To get it for
your tests, you can install a gem. All of the information is on the CircleCI
site.

This feature gives us this:

![Test metadata at the top](./circleci2-failures.png)

One more CircleCI feature: [storing artifacts]. I think this is normally for
compiled binaries of your app, but I'm going to use it for storing screenshots
of failed browser-based tests. [Rails 5.1 system specs] will do this
automatically, but you can also add it to older Rails projects with
[capybara-screenshot]. All we have to do is tell CircleCI where to find
artifacts.

Ideally, you could set up two more jobs here:

- job: `lint-rubocop`
- job: `lint-eslint`

But that's up to you.

[Rails 5.1 system specs]: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/testing.html#screenshot-helper
[JUnit]: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQ2R2_14.1.0/com.ibm.rsar.analysis.codereview.cobol.doc/topics/cac_useresults_junit.html
[storing artifacts]: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/
[collecting test metadata]: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/
[capybara-screenshot]: https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot

Lastly, we need to deploy the app:

```yaml
deploy-integration:
  docker:
    - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.1-node-browsers
      environment:
        BUNDLE_JOBS: 4
        BUNDLE_RETRY: 3
        BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle
        DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://root@localhost/my_project_test?pool=5"
    - image: circleci/postgres:9.3-alpine-ram
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: root
        POSTGRES_DB: my_project_test
  steps:
    - checkout
    - attach_workspace:
        at: ~/repo
    - run: bundle install
    - run: |
        git config --global user.name "CircleCI"
        bundle exec cap integration deploy

# copy and paste and modify for each environment
```

Nothing special here, but I do want to have CI identify itself as CircleCI for
the Capistrano process that uses git. Just like before, above assumes you've
configured the CircleCI project to [have the appropriate SSH keys][ssh], so it
can log into the server and perform the needed steps.

We've described the jobs, but we haven't described the workflow. Let's do that
now.

## Putting it together

```yaml
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-test-deploy:
    jobs:
      - bundle-install
      - npm-install
      - test:
          requires:
            - bundle-install
            - npm-install
      - deploy-integration:
          requires:
            - test
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
```

This describes the shape of your workflow. `bundle-install` and `npm-install`
don't have any requirements, so they can run in parallel. `test` requires the
installation steps to succeed before it can run, and `deploy-integration`
requires the test step to succeed, and only run when CI is running from
a commit on the `master` branch.

That gives us this shape:

![Workflow Shape](./circleci2-workflow.png)

Remember, if you also linted the code and had JavaScript tests, you could have
4 jobs running in parallel since they don't depend on each other (only
`npm-install` and/or `bundle-install`)

## YAML

We can make it a little better with a little bit of [YAML] knowledge. With
workflows, you'll repeat a lot of the same steps, and some of those steps can
be verbose. We can help that.

For example, we repeated `working_directory: ~/repo` a lot, as well as the
docker images for several jobs. Let's shorten it with a named anchor.

```yaml
defaults: &defaults
  working_directory: ~/repo
  docker:
    - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.1-node-browsers
      environment:
        BUNDLE_JOBS: 4
        BUNDLE_RETRY: 3
        BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle
        DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://root@localhost/my_project_test?pool=5"

    - image: circleci/postgres:9.3-alpine-ram
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: root
        POSTGRES_DB: my_project_test


## and then use it like this:

jobs:
  bundle-install:
    <<: *defaults
    steps: ...

  test:
    <<: *defaults
    steps: ...

  deploy-integration:
    <<: *defaults
    steps: ...
```

Nice!

[YAML]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

## Encore: What if I fork the repo from the client?

CircleCI is so helpful; they provide [environment variables] for you to check
for situations like this. We can ask some questions against those variables
with something like this:

```yaml
deploy-integration:
  <<: *defaults
  steps:
    - checkout
    - attach_workspace:
        at: ~/repo
    - run: |
        set -e
        # only deploy from upstream
        if [ "$CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME" == "ClientName" ]; then
          git config --global user.name "CircleCI"
          bundle install
          bundle exec cap integration deploy
        fi
```

Just add a dash of bash to make it work.

## Wrapping up

That concludes this episode of "know your tools". If you find anything wrong,
another cool feature, or an alternative approach, then tweet [@bernheisel] with
your recommendation.

By the way, there are other great CI platforms like [Travis CI], [GitLab],
[Google Cloud Build], and more. Today I'm using [CircleCI], but tomorrow
I might be trying out another platform. If above is way too much for you,
I would consider looking at [Travis CI]; they did a great job simplifying to
the essentials.
