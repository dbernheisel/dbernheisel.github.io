  There are some helpful techniques you can employ to help you and your
  coworkers when writing long changeset functions. It's hard to remember what's
  required, optional, and defaulted. DB-generated UUIDs. And composing
  changesets.

I use [Ecto Changesets][changeset] a lot-- a TON! and I love them. Since I've
been using them for a couple years now, I've noticed some patterns and now I
have a couple tips to share.

- [Extract Boilerplate](#extract-boilerplate)
- [DB-generated UUIDs](#db-generated-uuids)
- [Interpolate Your Docs](#interpolate-your-docs)
- [Compose Changesets](#compose-changesets)

## Extract Boilerplate

I use [UUID]s for all my IDs, specifically v4.

Long ago I managed some legacy codebases that chose (defaulted) integer-based
IDs, and two times now I've had to migrate them to tables with a BigSerial as
the ID because we reached our limit of IDs for the table. It's easy to forget.

I'd be fine with BigSerial, but since I started using Ecto, I found myself using
UUIDs instead, and now it's become a habit.

**What about showing UUIDs in URLs in basic CRUD endpoints?**

Yea, it's really ugly to show UUIDs in the browser URL bar, especially for
nested routes. But, should you show internal database IDs to users? I don't
think so, so when using UUIDs I am constantly reminded to design towards
generating unique slugs for UX. If you see a UUID in the browser URL, I feel
like I should replace it with a human-readable unique slug instead. IDs are for
machines, slugs are for humans. URLs are for humans too, though I understand
some may not agree with that.

### Let's default to UUID in Ecto

There's some configuration for Ecto to default to UUIDs:

1. [Configure Generators](#configure-generators)
1. [Configure Migrations](#configure-migrations)
1. [Configure Schema](#configure-schema)

Then lastly, we'll wrap that up and make it easier by [pulling it into a
macro](#pull-into-macro)

<a name="configure-generators"></a>

### Configure Generators

If you're using Phoenix and use its generators, you might care about this
section. When you run `mix phx.gen.schema ARGS`, Phoenix and Ecto will throw in
some boilerplate into your schemas and migrations. Even if you don't, it's
harmless to configure it just in case things change later, or other developers
on your project choose to use the generators.

  ```elixir
  #./config/config.exs
  config :my_app,
    ecto_repos: [MyApp.Repo],
    generators: [binary_id: true]

  # This will tell your Schema that the primary_key is a binary UUID:

  #./lib/my_app/random_schema.ex
  @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
  @foreign_key_type :binary_id
  schema "my_table" do
    # ...
  end
  ```

<a name="configure-migrations"></a>

### Configure Migrations

When creating tables through a migration, you'll need to specify that it should
not create an ID column that generates it's own IDs (more on this later).
Instead, we'll supply our own primary key column called `id`.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers do
  @moduledoc "Creating Users in the database"
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:users, primary_key: false) do
      add :id, :binary_id, primary_key: true

      timestamps()
    end
  end
end
```

In Ecto 3.x, you can also [reconfigure default ID column
settings](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Migration.html#module-repo-configuration)
with `:migration_primary_key` so you wouldn't even have to `add :id` yourself,
but unfortunately it does not play well with Ecto macros that I will end up
using since it's via Mix config.

<a name="configure-schema"></a>

### Configure Schema

If you're using the generators above, then they should insert these options in
for you, but if not, you'll need to make sure they're present.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RandomSchema do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
  @foreign_key_type :binary_id

  schema "users" do
    field :name, :string

    timestamps()
  end
end
```

That's it! It should work. Ecto's `schema` macro will use the module attributes
to configure how it should treat the primary key. [The documentation has more
information if you want to read more](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#module-schema-attributes).

<a name="pull-into-macro"></a>

### Pull Into Macro

That's a lot of boilerplate for _each schema_. Let's make it easier. Notice at
the top of the schema definition? `use Ecto.Schema`.

This injects some code into the module. We can do that too! Let's create our own
schema file that injects our boilerplate.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Schema do
  @moduledoc "Ecto Schema Helpers"

  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote do
      use Ecto.Schema
      import Ecto.Changeset

      @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
      @foreign_key_type :binary_id
    end
  end
end
```

```diff
defmodule MyApp.RandomSchema do
-   use Ecto.Schema
-   import Ecto.Changeset
-
-   @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
-   @foreign_key_type :binary_id
+   use MyApp.Schema

  schema "users" do
    field :name, :string

    timestamps()
  end
end
```

Now for each of your schemas, use this new module and you don't have to
remember the boilerplate anymore.

## DB-Generated UUIDs

Maybe you noticed above that we have `autogenerate: true` above. This is telling
**Ecto** to generate those ID UUIDs instead of the database. That bothered me; I
feel like that's a database responsibility, not an app responsibility.

Let's move that into the database. I'm using PostgreSQL, but I'm sure there are
similar tools for other databases.

1. [Enable pgcrypto](#enable-pgcrypto)
1. [Update our Boilerplate](#use-pgcrypto)

<a name="enable-pgcrypto"></a>

### Enable pgcrypto

Postgres unfortunately cannot generate UUIDs simply out of the box, but it does
ship with functions that you can enable. You can get away with creating a
function that'll generate UUIDs, but I prefer some battle-tested code that ships
with [postgres contrib].

One of those extensions is [pgcrypto] which supplies a function
`gen_random_uuid()`.

Let's create a migration to have Postgres enable the extension.

```shell-session
$ mix ecto.gen.migration add_pgcrypto
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.AddPgcrypto do
  @moduledoc "Add PgCrypto so we can have Postgres generate it's own IDs"
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    execute(
      "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"pgcrypto\"",
      "DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS \"pgcrypto\""
    )
  end
end
```

This sometimes requires special permissions on the database user. If this
doesn't work for you, then you might need an additional procedure to enable the
extension for you. However, this should work for your local database for
development.

[pgcrypto]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgcrypto.html
[postgres contrib]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html

<a name="use-pgcrypto"></a>

### Use pgcrypto

Now that the database can generate UUIDs, let's use it our ID columns!

First we'll tell ID column to default its value. Looking at our earlier
migration, let's modify it.

```diff
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers do
  @moduledoc "Creating Users in the database"
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:users, primary_key: false) do
-      add :id, :binary_id, primary_key: true
+      add :id, :binary_id, primary_key: true, default: fragment("gen_random_uuid()")

      timestamps()
    end
  end
end
```

Now it'll generate it's own ID. **If you stopped here, you'll notice that
when you insert records with Ecto, none of your returned structs will have an
ID!** What happened?!

We need to tell Ecto to [read the ID back into the struct after
writing](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#field/3-options).
Thankfully, that's easy. Earlier we pulled some boilerplate into a
`MyApp.Schema`; let's modify it:

```diff
defmodule MyApp.Schema do
  @moduledoc "Ecto Schema Helpers"

  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote do
      use Ecto.Schema
      import Ecto.Changeset

-      @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
+      @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, read_after_writes: true}
      @foreign_key_type :binary_id
    end
  end
end
```

Now Ecto will pull the database-generated UUID back. Yes! Now we have IDs
generated in the database again.

### Avoiding Collisions

Ok, so it's works, but what happens in the low low chance that it generated a
duplicate UUID? It will fail to insert since the primary key is unique. In this
case, you'll need to handle retrying with application code to retry once. The
probability of it failing a second time is galaxy-scale low. Probably not worth
handling in new code for smallish tables, and worth revisiting if you have very
large-scale tables in the millions or billions.

## Have Elixir Write Docs For You

One tedious task I find myself doing is trying to remember what fields I need,
don't need, and which ones have a default value if not supplied when interacting
with a changeset function. I'll constantly flip back and forth between my forms,
contexts, and schemas.

In VIM, I'm using [coc.nvim] to enable Language Server integration. You can do
this easily in [VSCode][vscode-ls] as well. One of the great features of this is
that you can lookup the documentation on a function with a keypress or hover.

![Documentation Hover](./documentation-hover.png)

See the screenshot and how it's listing out the required, optional, and default
fields? Let's make that happen.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RandomSchema do
  @moduledoc "The Random Schema."
  use MyApp.Schema

  @defaults %{
    type: "topical",
    is_invite_only: false,
    is_screening: false
  }

  schema "organizations" do
    field :name, :string
    field :type, :string, default: @defaults[:type]

    field :audience_description, :string
    field :is_invite_only, :boolean, default: @defaults[:is_invite_only]
    field :is_screening, :boolean, default: @defaults[:is_screening]

    timestamps()
  end

  @optional_fields ~w[is_invite_only is_screening screen_questions]a
  @required_fields ~w[name type audience_description]a

  @doc """
  Required fields: #{inspect @required_fields}
  Optional fields: #{inspect @optional_fields}
  Defaults: #{inspect @defaults}
  """
  @spec changeset(%__MODULE__{} | Ecto.Changeset.t(), map()) ::
    Ecto.Changeset.t()
  def changeset(struct \\ %__MODULE__{}, attrs) do
    struct
    |> cast(attrs, @optional_fields ++ @required_fields)
    |> validate_required(@required_fields)
  end
end
```

It's not hard at all! It's a feature I often forget exists with ExDocs and
Elixir: you can interpolate compiled values into documentation. In this case,
I'm defining my `@optional_fields`, `@required_fields`, and `@defaults`, and
then interpolating them into the changeset docs.

Easy peasy!

## Compose Changesets

Did you know that changesets can chain together?

For example:

Let's say you have a "main" changeset that performs the basic validations. These
validations should occur _every single time_ an insert or update occurs for this
schema. This happens for both admins and users.

Let's also say that you have another changeset that runs additional validations
if the User is updating the record versus the Admin updating the same record.
You don't have to duplicate that code!

```elixir
# In MySchema
@spec changeset(%__MODULE__{} | Ecto.Changeset.t(), map()) ::
  Ecto.Changeset.t()
def changeset(struct_or_changeset \\ %__MODULE__{}, attrs) do
  struct_or_changeset
  |> cast(attrs, @optional_fields ++ @required_fields)
  |> validate_required(@required_fields)
end

@spec additional_restrictions_changeset(%__MODULE__{} | Ecto.Changeset.t(), map()) ::
  Ecto.Changeset.t()
def additional_restrictions_changeset(struct_or_changeset \\ %__MODULE__{}, attrs) do
  struct_or_changeset
  |> changeset(attrs)
  |> more_validations()
end

@spec user_changeset(%__MODULE__{} | Ecto.Changeset.t(), map()) ::
  Ecto.Changeset.t()
def user_changeset(changeset, attrs) do
  changeset
  |> cast(attrs, [:some_more_fields])
  |> even_more_validations()
end

## ... In some other app code

def create(params) do
  MySchema.changeset(%MySchema{}, params)
end

def restricted_create(params) do
  MySchema.additional_restrictions_changeset(%MySchema{}, params)
end

def user_create(params) do
  %MySchema{}
  |> MySchema.changeset(params)
  |> MySchema.user_changeset(params)
end
```

This way, you can use `additional_restrictions_changeset/2` by itself and get
all the same logic within `changeset/2`. Or alternatively, compose them together
from the outside like in `user_create/1`

A common mistake that prevents changesets from being composable is that we'll
write our function signatures to require the struct as the first param:

```elixir
# don't do this:
@spec changeset(%__MODULE__{}, map()) :: Ecto.Changeset.t()
def changeset(%__MODULE__{} = struct, attrs) do
  struct
  |> cast(attrs, @optional_fields ++ @required_fields)
  |> validate_required(@required_fields)
end
```

This makes it more restrictive and keeps it from being composable.
