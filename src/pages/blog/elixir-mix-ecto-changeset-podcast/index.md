Coming from ActiveRecord, Ecto and Changesets were a wonderful alternative! They
cover my [other blog post](https://bernheisel.com/blog/ecto_changeset_tips/)
where I shared some tips and tricks for working with Changesets. We also cover
Ecto.Multi, how to compose Changesets, using "embedded" schemas, and much more!
